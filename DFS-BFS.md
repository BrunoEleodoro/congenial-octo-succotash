## Algo: DFS (Depth First Search)

### Description: 

This algorithm is related to graphs, we can use it to find paths, fast way to reach some node.

#### Types of graphs: 

- Directed Graph: only one direction (A -> B)
- Undirected Graph: both directions (A <-> B)

#### Types of connections

- Edge: Connection between nodes (A->B)
- Cycle Node: Can return to itself. (A -> A)
- Weighted: each connection has a weight value (e.g: distance)


### Code Example

```
hello world
```

### Time complexity / Space Complexity

```
O(V+E)
- V = vertices
- E = edges

Linear notation.
